When dealing with auction platforms, such as Bring a Trailer, this knowledge and attention to detail is critical to getting the most value out of your vehicle. Additionally, patient and thoughtful responses to all comments can be a time consuming process; however, failing to do so can stop an auction in it's tracks. So let us handle the process for you! We'll work with you to arrange pickup and drop-off of your vehicle for the duration of your auction, allowing us to effectively answer any and all commentor questions. We also recommend having professional  auction photos taken by our partner's over at [Chris Sweet's Photography](https://chrissweetsphotography.github.io/about.html). \n\n\nS﻿ome example auctions that we've run are [here](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1980-datsun-280zx-40/) and [here](https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1971-datsun-240z-271/).
